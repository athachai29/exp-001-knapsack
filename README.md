# exp-001-knapsack
This repository is an experimental playground to demonstrate how algorithm can drastically improve the performance for solving the classic Binary Knapsack problem.

The code demonstrates 4 approaches below (from the straightforward bruteforcing to mixing all the techniques together)

* Bruteforce 
* Backtracking
* Branch & Bound
* Mix between Backtracking and Brack & Bound

In summary, by altering only few lines of code, we can optimized the computational time to solve this problem... 

#### From 76 seconds to just only 1 second !!!

(tested on Macbook Pro 2015)


## How to run the code
You can simply run the code for all approaches in a single command below.
```
node index.js
```
